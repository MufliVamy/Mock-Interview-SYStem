The AI Mock Interview System is a project that aims to help individuals prepare for job interviews by providing a simulated interview experience. The system utilizes two natural language processing (NLP) models: a T5 model for generating interview questions and a BERT model for evaluating the user's responses.

Project Overview

The system works as follows:

1. Question Generation: The user provides a context or a job description, which is fed into the T5 model. The T5 model generates a list of relevant interview questions based on the given context.
2. User Response: From the generated list of questions, one question is presented to the user. The user then provides their response to the question.
3. Response Evaluation: The user's response is compared with the answer generated by the BERT model. The comparison is performed using two techniques:

a.Word-level Comparison: The cosine similarity between the user's response and the model's answer is calculated, providing a word-level similarity score.
b.Sentence-level Comparison: To account for semantic similarities beyond individual words, a sentence transformer function is employed to compare the user's response with the model's answer at the sentence level.


4. Rating: Based on the cosine similarity scores from both the word-level and sentence-level comparisons, the user's response is rated, providing feedback on their performance.
